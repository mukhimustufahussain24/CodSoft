## 1. Movie Genre Classification

**Task**: Build a model to classify movie genres based on their description.

**Approach**: 
- Preprocessed text data using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
- Used machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification.

**Dataset**: 
- The dataset contains movie descriptions and their associated genres.

## 2. Customer Churn Prediction

**Task**: Build a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service.

**Approach**: 
- Preprocessed the customer data.
- Used Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models to predict churn.

**Dataset**: 
- The dataset contains customer demographics and service usage data for a bank.

## 3. Spam SMS Detection

**Task**: Classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate (ham).

**Approach**: 
- Preprocessed text data using TF-IDF vectorization.
- Applied Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification.

**Dataset**: 
- The dataset contains SMS messages with labels indicating whether they are spam or ham.
